# Pandoc Intermediate Representation for Clojure

[Pandoc] is a lovely program for converting documents between formats.
This conversion happens by first converting from a source format to an intermediate representation, then converting from an intermediate representation to the target format.
`pandocir` lets you work with Pandoc IR as Clojure data.

## A library spawned from a Clojure/Oslo mob programming session

During [a Babashka Meetup in Oslo], we did some mob programming.
The task was to write a script that converts Pandoc JSON to Hiccup.
Some of us decided to give this code a bit more love.

The mob programming resulted in one commit:

## Use as a library

You can use `pandocir` as a Git dep with `deps.edn`:

``` clojure
io.github.teodorlu/pandocir {:git/sha "GIT SHA"}
```

Replace `"GIT SHA"` with the version you want.
If you don't want to copy Git SHAs by hand, consider using [Neil].

    neil dep add io.github.teodorlu/pandocir

For example usage, see the unit tests.
